# Microplastics leaching analysis

This is the Matlab code used in the paper "Understanding plasticiser leaching from polystyrene microplastics" by Alexandra M. Gulizia, Kishan Patel, Bronson Philippa, Cherie A. Motti, Lynne van Herwerden, and George Vamvounis (2022).

The script `curve_fitting.m` fits the model to the experimental data. The script `make_plots.m` generates the figures used in the manuscript.
