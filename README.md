# Microplastics leaching analysis

This is a diffusion model and curve fitting code for the analysis of leaching of plasticisers from microplastics. 

This is the code used in the paper "Leaching behaviours of plasticisers from polystyrene microplastics" by 
Alexandra M. Gulizia, Kishan Patel, Bronson Philippa, Cherie A. Motti, and George Vamvounis, which is currently under review.
